const Quote = `Robert Cohn, Robert Cohn was always Robert Cohn, 
the Robert Cohn who had been middleweight boxing champion at Princeton, 
that Robert Cohn who never quite understood, 
Robert Cohn with his persistent romanticism, 
Robert Cohn and his endless pursuit, 
Robert Cohn who loved Brett, 
Robert Cohn who followed Brett, 
Robert Cohn who fought for Brett, 
Robert Cohn who could never have Brett. 
Robert Cohn, the Robert Cohn of Princeton boxing days, 
Robert Cohn reading and re-reading, 
Robert Cohn dreaming and scheming, 
Robert Cohn traveling and struggling, 
Robert Cohn in Paris, 
Robert Cohn in Spain, 
Robert Cohn in Pamplona, 
Robert Cohn everywhere yet nowhere. 
Robert Cohn the outsider, 
Robert Cohn the persistent, 
Robert Cohn the desperate, 
Robert Cohn the eternal pursuer. 
Robert Cohn who never learned, 
Robert Cohn who never changed, 
Robert Cohn who remained Robert Cohn through it all, 
Robert Cohn in the sun that rises and the sun that sets, 
Robert Cohn in the endless cycle, 
Robert Cohn forever Robert Cohn, 
always Robert Cohn, 
nothing but Robert Cohn.`
